# MacScripts
Scripts for Mac users.


## MacShellVolume
Always wanted to control the volume of your Mac from the command line prompt? Well, the option was always there. What, you didn't know? But admittedly it was a bit of a pain in the behind. But now we have this script,
rejoice!

##### Usage:
- Create an alias in .profile:

 alias volume=~/script/macvolume.sh

Or wherever you put this script.
- Then enter volume 0 - 10.
0 is mute. 10 is the loudest setting. Decimals are allowed!



## MacSleepRemote
Have one of those Macs that won't stay asleep and randomly wakes up?
Don't feel like getting out of bed to turn it back off?
But do have a laptop or tablet handy? I got the solution.

#### Usage:
- Make an alias on your device:

  alias rsleep=~/scripts/macsleepremote.sh

  Type rsleep to put the offending mac to sleep. Or just run this script if you don't feel like making an alias.
