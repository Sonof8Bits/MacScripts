# MacShellVolume
Always wanted to control the volume of your Mac from the command line prompt? Well, the option was always there. What, you didn't know? But admittedly it was a bit of a pain in the behind. But now we have this script,
rejoice!

##### Usage:
Create an alias in .profile:
 alias volume=~/script/macvolume.sh
Or wherever you put this script.
Then enter volume 0 - 10.
0 is mute. 10 is the loudest setting. Decimals are allowed!
